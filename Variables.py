# py dont define a datatype 
# to define a variable : name=value

# name2=farah  this is a wrong way it will be considerd as a variable 
name='farah'
age=22
salary=3.5

# type casting

age_f=float(age)
salary_i=int(salary)
age_s=str(age)


# getting the type of a variable 
# print(type(age_s))


# names are case sensitive
Age=20
age=10

# camel,pascal or snake  case all work for naming 


# assigning multiple values respectivly
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"

# one value assiging to multiple variables
x = y = z = "Orange"

# unpacking will give each variable a value at its  respective index
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)



# variables work within a scope
# if u define  variable   with same name globaly and inside a function it will take the inside scope 
# to change the value of a global variable inside a funtion use  global  key word
